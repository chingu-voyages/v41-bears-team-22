Authenticated users will be directed to a homepage where they can easily track the status of applications, and easily reconnect with the contacts they have associated with those applications.</p>
    <p align="left">This fullstack application was created and deployed within a collaborative team using Github as version control. This was designed with an agile development cycle to allow for frequent updates to the team's work.</p>
